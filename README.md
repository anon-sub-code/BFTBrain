# BFTBrain

This is the code base for the anonymous paper submission "BFTBrain: Adaptive BFT Consensus with Reinforcement Learning".

## Mode 1 - No switching

This mode is useful for testing a _fixed_ protocol inside our protocol pool. To enable this mode:

* Change the `config.framework.yaml` file (or any corresponding framework config file) as below. 
  * Set `general.learning` to be `false`.
  * Set `benchmark.checkpoint-size` to be a very large value, e.g., `1000000000`.


## Mode 2 - Switching in pre-defined order

This mode is useful for testing _purely_ the switching part, i.e., without the learning component. To enable this mode:

* Change the `config.framework.yaml` file (or any corresponding framework config file) as below. 
  * Set `general.learning` to be `false`.
  * Set `benchmark.checkpoint-size` to be a reasonable value, e.g., `5000`, `1000`, or `500`. This represents the epoch length in terms of blocks.
  * Set `switching.debug-sequence` to be a pre-defined sequence that you want to use.


* If running BFTBrain on a single machine, run 
  ```bash
  cd BFTBrain/scripts/ && ./local_exp.sh pbft
  ``` 
  Here PBFT will be used for the first epoch. Then it switches protocols using the pre-defined sequence in a round-robin fashion.


* If running BFTBrain distributedly on CloudLab, simply use the miyuki automation tool. See the deployment section below.

## Mode 3 - Switching via learning agent

This mode should be used when running final evaluations of the end-to-end BFTBrain system, where the decision of next protocol is given by the decentralized learning agent. To enable this mode:

* Change the `config.framework.yaml` file (or any corresponding framework config file) as below. 
  * Set `general.learning` to be `true`.
  * Set `benchmark.checkpoint-size` to be a reasonable value.
  * Set `general.report-sequence` to be a reasonable value, e.g., `0.5 * benchmark.checkpoint-size`. Set `general.exchange-sequence` to be a reasonable value larger than the report sequence, e.g., `0.6 * benchmark.checkpoint-size`.
  * Remove the field `switching.debug-sequence`.

* If running BFTBrain on a single machine, run 
  ```bash
  cd BFTBrain/scripts/ && ./local_exp.sh pbft learning
  ``` 
  Here PBFT will be used for the first epoch, before the learning agent kicks in.

  The learning agents are created in a seperate tmux session. You can attach to the session using `tmux attach -t cloudlab-learning`.


* If running BFTBrain distributedly on CloudLab, simply use the miyuki automation tool. See the deployment section below.

## Deployment and Experiments

### Miyuki Automation Tool Overview

Miyuki can be used on any machine to instantiate Cloudlab instances and launch experiments.

Due to legacy issues, each experiment consist of a `master` node, i.e. `controller`, and some `workers` node. They are two different Cloudlab experiments.

It is recommended here to yet launch another machine on Cloudlab to run Miyuki instead of running locally, as the network connection is more stable there.

Overall Usage:

```bash
$ ./scripts/miyuki/main.py --help
usage: main.py [-h] --experiment EXPERIMENT --profile PROFILE [--project PROJECT] {deploy,gridsearch,reproduce,single,collect,terminate,sync}

Start a BFTBrain experiment.

### Setup

0. Run locally or instantiate another machine on Cloudlab, login.
1. Preparation for any task issuer machine [RUNNING ONCE IS ENOUGH]: Clone repo, adjust permission for private key, install python3-pip, install python dependencies
   ```bash
   # clone repository
   git clone https://github.com/anon-osdi-24/BFTBrain
   # setup script
   ./BFTBrain/scripts/miyuki/setup.sh
   ```

### Deploy

Issue deployment task via Miyuki. Usage:

```bash
set +o history && USER='USER_NAME' PWORD='PASSWORD' ./BFTBrain/scripts/miyuki/main.py -e <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -p <PROFILE_NAME> deploy
```

More examples:

Reproduce all configs in a folder on a deployed instance through miyuki. Usage:

```bash
set +o history && USER='USER_NAME' PWORD='PASSWORD' ./BFTBrain/scripts/miyuki/main.py -e <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -p <PROFILE_NAME> reproduce <CONFIGS_PATH>
```

### Run Single Config Once

Run single protocol once, interactive mode, stop when user types stop.

```bash
set +o history && USER='USER_NAME' PWORD='PASSWORD' ./BFTBrain/scripts/miyuki/main.py -e <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -p <PROFILE_NAME> single <PROTOCOL_NAME> --config <CONFIG_PATH>
```

### Experiment Data Analysis and Collection

Analyze data and collect results via Miyuki. Usage:

```bash
set +o history && USER='USER_NAME' PWORD='PASSWORD' ./BFTBrain/scripts/miyuki/main.py -e <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -p <PROFILE_NAME> collect
```

### Termination

Terminate instances via Miyuki. Usage:

```bash
set +o history && USER='USER_NAME' PWORD='PASSWORD' ./BFTBrain/scripts/miyuki/main.py -e <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -p <PROFILE_NAME> terminate
```

### Sync

Sync the file on this machine to both master and workers.

```bash
set +o history && USER='USER_NAME' PWORD='PASSWORD' ./BFTBrain/scripts/miyuki/main.py -e <EXPERIMENT_NAME> -p <PROFILE_NAME> sync
```

### Notes

* `scripts/miyuki/cloudlab.pem`: See https://gitlab.flux.utah.edu/powder-profiles/powder-control/-/tree/master
  > You'll also need to download your Powder credentials. You'll find a button to do so in the drop-down menu accessed by clicking on your username after logging into the Powder portal. This will download a file called `cloudlab.pem`, which you will need later.
* `scripts/miyuki/id_cloudlab`: Private key for Cloudlab SSH
* Known issues:
  * There might be some bug regarding fetching the logfile per machine.
  * If there is bug using `single`, it is always a good idea to use `reproduce` by only including one single configuration file and then specify the trial to be 1 and some specific duration. `single` might not be useful for debugging, but is especially useful when you want to monitor the result instantly and do quick experiment to see if the things work.

## Two-site WAN Experiment

* Use Miyuki's `--profile2` (`-p2`) parameter to specify the second profile.
* Remember to change the generated `BFTBrain/scripts/servers.txt` on master node to make sure
  * Coordinator, client, and the fast nodes are on the same cluster. By convention, the first line should be the coordinator, the last line should be the client. **Important: THE FILE SHOULD NOT CONTAIN A TRAILING NEW LINE CHARACTER!!!**
  * Here is an example config:
    ```
    xxxxxx@node-0.2-sitew.bft-evaluation-PG0.utah.cloudlab.us
    xxxxxx@node-1.2-sitew.bft-evaluation-PG0.utah.cloudlab.us
    xxxxxx@node-2.2-sitew.bft-evaluation-PG0.utah.cloudlab.us
    xxxxxx@node-0.2-sitew2.bft-evaluation-PG0.wisc.cloudlab.us
    xxxxxx@node-1.2-sitew2.bft-evaluation-PG0.wisc.cloudlab.us
    xxxxxx@node-3.2-sitew.bft-evaluation-PG0.utah.cloudlab.us
    ```
* Make sure to use Miyuki's `--public` (`-u`) parameter to start any experiment!!!
